# ReactiveTransportAnalyser
# Reactive Transport Analyzer for CO₂ Reactions

# Overview

This tutorial provides a structured workflow for conducting single-phase flow simulations, aligning flow field images, analyzing voxel distributions, and evaluating mineral transport within a porous medium. It includes step-by-step instructions on input files, expected outputs, and usage of key scripts for data processing.

**Note:** The example shown is Sample A at 33 min (488 PV).

# Procedure

# 1. Single-Phase Flow Simulation

The single-phase flow simulator can be found here **[Porefoam1f](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/poreFoam-singlePhase)**.

## Input Files:

- Segmented Image: The image should be segmented into two phases: pore space and rock.

  - Label 0: Pore

  - Label 1: Rock

**Note:** If Avizo is used, the 'Exterior' material is alway Label 0 and is everything that isn't segmented into another material. So everything needs to be segmented except the pore space so that it would be the only thing in the 'Exterior' material and have the  Label 0. Also, the outer layer has to be segmented as rock so that flow is only simulated through the pore space.  

**(See Screenshot 1)**

## Required Output Files:

- Velocity Files: Velocities at the cell face (Ufx, Ufy, Ufz) **(See Screenshot 3)**

  - Used as an input for the image alignment code.

- Summary File **(See Screenshot 3 & Screenshot 4)**

![screenshot_4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44069493-c5b5-4b1b-be08-02639f27c0de)


  - Contains permeability, connected porosity, and velocity distribution (probability density functions, PDFs).

- OpenMelnParaview.foam **(See Screenshot 3)**

  - Used for visualizing the velocity field in Paraview.


# 2. Image Alignment Code (Flowfield_Image_Alignment_Code)

This code corrects the misalignment between the flow field image and the segmented image used in the single-phase simulation. The misalignment occurs because the simulator outputs velocities at the cell face (Ufx, Ufy, Ufz) instead of at the cell center (Ux, Uy, Uz). The code adjusts for this discrepancy and calculates the velocity magnitude.

## Input Files:

- Velocities at the cell face (Ufx, Ufy, Ufz) (See Screenshot 3)

## Output File:

- Flow Field Image (See Screenshot 5)

**Screenshot 5: Output Folder from Image Alignment Code**

# 3. Voxel Count & Pore Exposure Analysis (VoxelNumber_and_FacesToPore)

The VoxelNumber_and_FacesToPore script calculates:

- The number of voxels for each label in the segmented image:

  - Label 1: Outer layer

  - Label 2: Pore

  - Label 3: Microporous phase

  - Label 4: Dolomite

  - Label 5: Calcite

  - Label 6: Anhydrite
 
    **Note: Label 0 is ignored**
  
**(See Screenshot 6)**

- The number of faces of all other labels that are exposed to the pore label.

**Note:** This script requires two segmented images: one at T1 = x and another at T2 = x+1 or T2 = x+y, where y is an integer.

## Input Files:

- Two segmented images with labels **(See Screenshot 6)**.

**Screenshot 6: Segmented Image (Label 1 to 5)**

- Number of voxels for each label in both images.

- Difference in voxel count between T1 and T2.

- Number of faces to pore label in both images.

# 4. Mineral Distribution Analysis (Proximity_VoxelNumber_Code)

The Mineral Distribution Code (Proximity_VoxelNumber_Code) calculates the number of voxels for each label at the face of a flow region and those moving away from the face.

The flow regions are defined as fast channels and slow regions **(See Screenshot 8)**.


Distance maps of the fast flow and slow regions (fastflowdistmap.tif and slowregionsdistmap.tif) are used in combination with the segmented image.

The script outputs the voxel count for all labels at the face and away from the face in both fast and slow regions **(See Screenshot 8)**.


## Input Files:

- Distance maps (fastflowdistmap.tif, slowregionsdistmap.tif). **Note:** Process of aquisition detialed below. 

- Segmented image (with labels 1 to 6) **(See Screenshot 6)**

## Output File:

- Excel Spreadsheet containing **(See Screenshot 9)**.

- Number of voxels at the face and away from the face for all labels in fast and slow regions.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Defining Fast Channels and Slow Regions, Obtaining Distance Maps and Fast Channel Dissolved Minerals 




**Screenshots: Overview: Defining Fast Channels and Slow Regions**

![Screenshot 8a (fast channel defination)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdda27e1-fe51-4406-bc23-ab4fbb2e7406)
![screenshot_8b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af820397-9172-427d-9bc1-8373647bb304)

**Screenshots: Procedure: Defining Fast Channels and Slow Regions**


Open in Avizo:
- Grayscale image
- Flow field image

Make sure the properties highlighted in red are identical for both images. This is required to ensure the images are aligned perfectly.

![ff1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ba357a0-441e-4626-adfb-874f96625856)


Atach a histogram module to the flow field image. Generate a histogram from with :
- Range = 0 to 1E-6
- 128 bins

Save histogram as .csv file. 

![ff2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6e56fe-8b10-468c-8537-f821d92d839f)


Copy the Darcy velocities (first column)

![ff3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d39276-8748-40ab-bf7e-bb2e0156b6b0)


Plot PDF.

![ff4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83493d7b-df65-4878-a72c-6a1ef424bc68)



Calculate CDF and CDF (%). Plot CDF (%).

![ff5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ad2ba35-e3b0-48c0-bdb3-36a574ea54ef)


Paste the Darcy velocities next to PDF. CDF and CDF (%). Then go to 75% CDF and obtain the following:
- Darcy velocity for thresholding fast channels (red). (Darcy velocity 7.32E-07) 
- The corresponding x-axis (blue) and y-axis (yellow) values used in identifying fast channel velocities on the velocity distribution (PDF) plot.
  
![ff6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c53f310-5bf0-4cb1-ac6f-ffc5634ba848)

![ff7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1869f0a6-8cf0-4efb-b868-fea51beaa0ef)


In Avizo, threshold, segment snd save the whole flow field to a new ‘Label field’ :
- Threshold from 1E-22 to end of data. 

![ff8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b35ec764-36c0-4dd2-8517-b5f6a048f354)


Threshold, segment snd save the fast flow seed to a new ‘Label field’ :
- Threshold from 7.32E-07 to end of data. 

![ff9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a8e8134-8a51-4ac6-93f5-04168251b8ca)


View the grayscale image with the fast flow seed (blue). Attach the ‘Dilation’ module to the fast flow seed and dilate by the minimum number of pixels required to reach the nearest pore wall. It was 3 pixels (3px ) in this case.  The dilated region is shown in red.

![ff10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/759375c3-d3f3-437d-a07b-a3a97b80aebb)


Where the dilated region overlaps rock, the rock image is subtracted. Using expression:
- A-B


The result is a fast flow channel where blue depicts the faster velocities at the middle of the fast channel and the green depicts slower velocities  closer to the pore walls.


![ff11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d41e9df-9c90-418c-ae18-762a7aabbd27)



To get the slow regions, we subtract the fast channels from the whole flow field using expression:
- A-B


![ff12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7addad0-49d5-465d-b457-909da9fbaea2)


# **Screenshot: Procedure: Distance Mapss**

To obtain distance maps, attach the ‘Chamfer Distance Map’ module to the fast channel and slow regions images. Select 3D in ‘Interpretation’ port.

![ff13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed7c2632-acd0-4f4c-98ce-a52d3d3367c8)


# **Outputs: Fast Channel ans Slow Regions Image, Distance Maps**

Now we have the fast channel and slow regions image along with the corresponding distance maps. All of these file should be exported and saved as individual .TIFF files. They will be used in later calculations and visualisation. 

![ff14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2945df2e-2a3b-4cf4-ad0e-0b2aefbb1d09)


# **Procedure: Fast Channel Dissolved Minerals**

‘2-3-mpd.am’, ‘2-3-dol.am’, ‘2-3-cal.am’ & ‘2-3-anhy.am’ are images that contain the minerals dissolved between scan 2 (33 min) and scan 3 (66 min).  That is scan 2 minus scan 3.

‘33fastflow.channel.am’ is the fast channel image at scan 3 (66 min). 

These files are the input files required to obtain the fast channel dissolved minerals.

Using the ‘Arithmetic’ module,  multiply ‘2-3-mpd.am’ and ‘33fastflow.channel.am’  using the expression;
- A*B

## Input Files
- Dissolved mineral image (i.e., ‘2-3-mpd.am’, ‘2-3-dol.am’, ‘2-3-cal.am’ & ‘2-3-anhy.am’)
- Fast channel image ‘(33fastflow.channel.am’)

## Outout Files
- Fast channel dissolved minerals images (i.e., ‘2-3-mpd_fast_dissolved’, ‘2-3-dol_fast_dissolved’, ‘2-3-cal_fast_dissolved’ & ‘2-3-anhy_fast_dissolved’).


**Note:** Export and save all output files individually as . TIFF files. They will be used in Paraview for visualization.

# **Procedure: Proximity Function Profiles**

The proximity function quantifies mineral exposure relative to fast transport channels, defined as the voxel count per unit exposed surface area at a given distance. This function helps assess exposure variations and their impact on transport dynamics.

![Screenshot 2025-03-14 at 18 38 33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2858d719-218a-4331-90cd-bd279eaaab1f)


## Input Files:

- Mineral distribution ( Number of voxels at the face and away from the face of the fast channel) (from Proximity_VoxelNumber_Code).
- Exposed surface area (m^2)(from VoxelNumber_abd_FacesToPore_Code).

## Output File:

- Proximity function (voxel/m^2)


Calculate proximity function.
